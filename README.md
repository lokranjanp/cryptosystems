If you want to run the above algorithms on a Laptop with ARM based Architecture, use the following commands:
* To compile the code : || g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp ||
* To access the executable file (a.out) : || ./a.out ||

If you dont have g++ or clang compilers by default you can use the gcc compiler.
The command remains mostly same, just change the ("g++") to "gcc".

If you still face any problems related to compilation, try to compile the files after moving to different directories

HAPPY ENCRYPTING! :)
